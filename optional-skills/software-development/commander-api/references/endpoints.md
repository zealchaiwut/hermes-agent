# Commander API — Full Endpoint Reference

~155 routes, no global prefix (a few routers set one — noted per group). This
file is the on-demand catalogue; `SKILL.md` only carries the ~12 routes an
agent reaches for daily. For anything not listed here, or to check whether a
route's shape has changed, fetch the live schema:

```bash
python3 scripts/commander_api.py spec --path <substring>
```

## Risk tiers

- **SAFE** — GET, read-only, call freely.
- **WRITE** — mutates state but is low blast-radius (a todo, a dismissed
  suggestion, a draft). Requires `--confirm`; mention to the user what
  you're about to do first, but a quick heads-up is enough.
- **HIGH-RISK** — spawns paid agent runs, deletes data, merges/deploys code,
  or otherwise can't be casually undone. Requires `--confirm`; get the
  user's *explicit, specific* approval first ("dispatch sprint-119?", not a
  standing "sure go ahead").

## Project identifier quirk (verified against a live instance — this is not
## documented anywhere in Commander itself, so don't assume it, use it)

Commander uses **two different project identifiers** depending on which
router you're hitting, and passing the wrong one either 404s or silently
resolves to nothing:

- Query-string style (`?project=...`) — e.g. `/api/board`, `/api/running` —
  wants the dashboard's internal **id**: `owner-repo` with a dash
  (`zealchaiwut-commander`).
- Path-param style (`/api/projects/{project}/...`) — e.g. `running-sprint`,
  `advisor/suggestions`, `todos` — wants the **bare repo name**
  (`commander`, not `zealchaiwut/commander` and not `zealchaiwut-commander`).

When in doubt, call `GET /api/projects` first and use `id` for query-string
routes, `repo` (stripped of the `owner/` prefix) for path-param routes.
